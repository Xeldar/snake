# Snake dot JS 0.1
Simple snake with canvas &amp; javascript (no librairies) ES6

# Purpose
I started building a snake with only html (divs) and javascript for fun,

But then I realised that I never used canvas before, so I converted my first html snake using canvas and javascript

Of course it's not perfect at all, but I will continue to improving it and make it mobile friendly

# TODO
- Mobile friendly
- Optimisation
- Smooth
